Teknobarn is THE premiere food/alcohol/music festival in Leesport, PA.  Ok perhaps it's not quite a 'festival' yet... but we're getting there!  Join an all star cast of partiers for a madness-filled weekend in the farmlands of Pennsylvania.  Experience the Year of the Goat like it's meant to be... with an all-you-can-eat, all-you-can-drink, no holds barred adventure where your only concern will be not getting lost in the corn field.  If you're not persuaded by the above list, ask someone who has been there before, it is truly a magical place.  And don't worry, the cows are long gone, so you don't have to worry about being run over by stampeding cattle... and yes, we have air conditioning and indoor plumbing and (gasp!) even wifi.
